# UDT Java implementation
#

This is a native Java implementation of the UDT protocol.


#
# Sample applications
#

We provide "send-file" and "receive-file" scripts that work analogously to their C++ counterparts.

To start a file "server",

  bin/send-file <server_port>
  
To download a file from the server,

  bin/receive_file <server_host> <server_port> <remote_filename> <local_filename>
  

#
# Setting up a development environment using Eclipse
#

You will need Apache Maven from http://maven.apache.org

To generate Eclipse project files,

  mvn eclipse:eclipse
  
Then, import the project into your workspace.
